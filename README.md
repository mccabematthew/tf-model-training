# My TensorFlow Learning Pathway

The purpose of this repository is to record my progress in training to earn a certification in TensorFlow. 
I will be following the TensorFlow (and by extension udacity, oreilly, and coursera) curriculum to gain an
understanding of machine learning and earn the google TensorFlow certification. I will also be creating my 
own machine learning projects, and eventually, will integrate TensorFlow lite into an android application.

Feel free to follow along, and reach out so we can talk ML!

## *The Learning Track*

The first step in gaining the ability to use tensor flow, and the cert. will be
finishing tensor flow's curated learning pathway. Details below -> 

### `"Step 1: Learning What ML is all About"`

#### What We'll Learn

1. Learn best practices for using TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework
2. Build a basic neural network in TensorFlow
3. Train a neural network for a computer vision application
4. Understand how to use convolutions to improve your neural network

>Deep Learning with Python has taught thousands of readers how to put the full capabilities of deep learning into action. 
This extensively revised full color second edition introduces deep learning using Python and Keras, and is loaded with insights 
for both novice and experienced ML practitioners. You’ll learn practical techniques that are easy to apply in the real world, 
and important theory for perfecting neural networks.

**Links We'll Need**
- [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition) Chapters 1-4
- [Intro to TensorFlow for Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning--ud187)

### `"Step 2: Beyond The Basics"`

#### What We'll Learn

1. Best practices for TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework to train a neural network for a computer vision applications.
2. Handle real-world image data and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout.
3. Build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow.
4. Apply RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs as you train them using text repositories.

### `"Step 3: Practice"`

#### What We'll Learn

1. The world is your oyster (i.e. this is open ended). The link shows some beginner and advanced tutorials.

**Link We'll Need**
- [Tensor Flow Core Tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)

### `"Step 4: Go Deeper With TensorFlow"`

#### What We'll Learn

1. Explore several training models, including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methods
2. Dive into neural net architectures, including convolutional nets, recurrent nets, and deep reinforcement learning
3. Learn techniques for training and scaling deep neural nets
4. Use the TensorFlow library to build and train neural nets

> By using concrete examples, minimal theory, and two production-ready Python frameworks—Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow—author Aurélien Géron 
helps you gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts and tools for building intelligent systems. You’ll learn a range of techniques, 
starting with simple linear regression and progressing to deep neural networks. With exercises in each chapter to help you apply what you’ve 
learned, all you need is programming experience to get started.
